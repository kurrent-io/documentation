title: Why Kurrent?
---

Traditional databases often focus only on current state and overwrite data, which discards valuable information about the past and the events that shaped the current state.

In contrast, KurrentDB keeps a complete history of changes, providing organizations with richer, and more contextual data that supports deeper insights - critical in today’s AI and data-driven environment.

::: details Use Case: Machine Learning

A German tool manufacturer leveraged historical events from KurrentDB on manufacturing times and tool specifications (such as length and diameter) to [predict manufacturing durations for custom tools](https://www.kurrent.io/blog/from-data-to-insights-using-event-log-data-to-train-machine-learning-models). This prediction was then integrated into an online quote system, which automated the generation of instant, more accurate quotes—a significant improvement over the previous method of the sales team creating quotes based mainly on their experience.

KurrentDB also includes additional features that make it simple to develop event-native applications that enable real-time updates and minimize system dependencies while maintaining data consistency.

::: details Use Case: Real-time Streaming

You can use KurrentDB to streamline your payment process. Holcim, a global construction material provider [replaced batch processing with real-time streaming of payment statuses](https://www.kurrent.io/case-studies/holcim) from SAP system to depots.  In doing so, Holcim eliminated the previous day-long wait for payment verification and order collection. 

These types of significant improvements in customer service and operational efficiency can provide a competitive edge regardless of industry.

Finally, KurrentDB can reconstruct the current state of any object from its historical events. In doing so, KurrentDB provides the current and historical context that allows organizations to clearly understand the "what" and "why" (and "when") within a single system.



## Who Uses KurrentDB?

Data engineers can provide context-rich events from KurrentDB to data pipelines to analyze historical and behavioral trends, uncovering patterns that traditional databases often miss. These patterns can, for example, reveal why a customer churned or highlight behaviors that lead to high-value contracts.



Application developers can leverage KurrentDB's granular events to build real-time, distributed enterprise applications and break down tightly coupled systems. Events are typically simpler, self-contained, and independent. Unlike the tables and rows in traditional databases that are often interdependent with various functions.

::: details Use Case: Modernize Legacy Systems

Insureon, an independent marketplace for online delivery of small business insurance, used KurrentDB to [modernize its legacy monolithic system](https://www.kurrent.io/case-studies/insureon), which was brittle and challenging to deploy. With KurrentDB, Insureon could provide new solutions faster without sacrificing scalability. This dramatically improved the company's business creativity and agility.

## Where to Use KurrentDB?

KurrentDB is valuable for critical enterprise applications and data pipelines with behavior-rich data, where interdependent business objects and processes interact in diverse ways over time. 

Industries such as finance, healthcare, supply chain, and manufacturing benefit from KurrentDB, as it supports flexible, scalable solutions with a complete audit trail. This enables businesses to maintain clear, comprehensive system oversight, which is essential for meeting compliance requirements and adapting to changing needs.
