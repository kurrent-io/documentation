# Part 2: Initialize KurrentDB with Sample Orders for Sales Report

In this part, you will start a KurrentDB instance and initialize it with a few hundred order events. These orders will be used to construct sales reports in part 3.

## Step 2: Start Databases and Append OrderPlaced Event to KurrentDB

1. Once your Codespace is loaded, run this command in the terminal to start KurrentDB, and append sample events to it:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/1-start-dbs-and-generate-data.sh
   ```

   This can take a minute or so.

2. After a while, you will see the following message printed in the terminal:

   ```
   KurrentDB has started.
   Seeding data to KurrentDB... this may take a while.
   17:44:00 info: edb-commerce[0] Executing command 'seed-data-set' with settings {"InputPath":"/workspaces/edu-samples/time-travel/data/data.few-hundred-orders.json","ConnectionString":"esdb://localhost:2113?tls=false"}

   Appended data to KurrentDB

   ðŸš€ KurrentDB Server has started!! ðŸš€

   URL to the KurrentDB Admin UI ðŸ‘‰: https://XXXXXXXXX.XXX
   ```

3. Copy the URL printed in the terminal from the last step.

4. Open a new browser tab. 

5. In the address bar of the new tab, paste the URL and navigate to it.

6. This will display the KurrentDB Admin UI.

## Step 3: Browse OrderPlaced Events in KurrentDB's Admin UI

1. Click the `Stream Browser` link from the top navigation bar.

2. Under `Recently Changed Streams`, click the `$et-order-placed` link.

   ::: tip
   You may have noticed other streams and events in KurrentDB. You can safely ignore them for the purpose of this tutorial. 
   :::

   ::: info Understanding Event Type System Projection
   The `$et-order-placed` system stream contains all `order-placed` events across all streams in KurrentDB. This uses KurrentDB's "by event type" system projection stream feature. For more information, see [System Projections](https://docs.kurrent.io/server/v25.0/features/projections/system.html#by-event-type).

3. You should see a sequenced list of the appended `order-placed` events associated to a few hundred orders.

4. Click on one of the events to see the order details.
