# Clients

Building with KurrentDB begins with choosing the right client library for your
programming language. KurrentDB client libraries provide the essential tools and
APIs needed to integrate your applications with KurrentDB's event streaming
platform, whether you're using [Kurrent Cloud](/cloud/introduction.md) or
deploying [on-premises](https://www.kurrent.io/kurrent-platform-editions).

KurrentDB maintains and actively develops client libraries for multiple
programming languages. Our engineering team continuously enhances these
libraries with new features, performance optimizations, security updates, and
compatibility improvements to support your needs.
