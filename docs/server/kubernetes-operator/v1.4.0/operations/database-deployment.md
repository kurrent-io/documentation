title: Example Deployments
order: 1
---

This page shows various deployment examples of KurrentDB.  Each example assumes the that the
Operator has been installed in a way that it can at least control KurrentDB resources in the
`kurrent` namespace.

Each example is designed to illustrate specific techniques:

* [Single Node Insecure Cluster](#single-node-insecure-cluster) is the "hello world" example
  that illustrates the most basic features possible.  An insecure cluster should not be used in
  production.

* [Three Node Insecure Cluster with Two Read-Only Replicas](
  #three-node-insecure-cluster-with-two-read-only-replicas) illustrates how to deploy a clustered
  KurrentDB instance and how to add read-only replicas to it.

* [Three Node Secure Cluster (using self-signed certificates)](
  #three-node-secure-cluster-using-self-signed-certificates) illustrates how to secure a cluster with
  self-signed certificates using cert-manager.

* [Three Node Secure Cluster (using LetsEncrypt)](
  #three-node-secure-cluster-using-letsencrypt) illustrates how to secure a cluster with LetsEncrypt.

* [Deploying Standalone Read-only Replicas](#deploying-standalone-read-only-replicas) illustrates
  an advanced topology where a pair of read-only replicas is deployed in a different Kubernetes
  cluster than where the quorum nodes are deployed.

* [Deploying With Scheduling Constraints](#deploying-with-scheduling-constraints): illustrates how
  to deploy a cluster with customized scheduling constraints for the KurrentDB pods.

* [Custom Database Configuration](#custom-database-configuration) illustrates how to make direct
  changes to the KurrentDB configuration file.

## Single Node Insecure Cluster

The following `KurrentDB` resource type defines a single node cluster with the following properties:

- The database will be deployed in the `kurrent` namespace with the name `kurrentdb-cluster`
- Security is not enabled
- KurrentDB version 25.0.0 will be used
- 1 vCPU will be requested as the minimum (upper bound is unlimited)
- 1 GB of memory will be used
- 512 MB of storage will be allocated for the data disk
- The KurrentDB instance that is provisioned will be exposed as `kurrentdb-0.kurrent.test`

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 1
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}.{domain}'
```

## Three Node Insecure Cluster with Two Read-Only Replicas

Note that read-only replicas are only supported by KurrentDB in clustered configurations, that is,
with multiple quorum nodes.

The following `KurrentDB` resource type defines a three node cluster with the following properties:
- Security is not enabled
- 1 GB of memory will be used per quorum node, but read-only replicas will have 2 GB of memory
- The quorum nodes will be exposed as `kurrentdb-{idx}.kurrent.test`
- The read-only replicas will be exposed as `kurrentdb-replica-{idx}.kurrent.test`

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}.{domain}'
  readOnlyReplicas:
    replicas: 2
```

## Three Node Secure Cluster (using self-signed certificates)

The following `KurrentDB` resource type defines a three node cluster with the following properties:
- Security is enabled using self-signed certificates
- The KurrentDB servers will be exposed as `kurrentdb-{idx}.kurrent.test`
- Servers will dial each other by Kubernetes service name (`*.kurrent.svc.cluster.local`)
- Clients will dial servers by the FQDN (`*.kurrent.test`)
- The self-signed certificate is valid for both service name and FQDN.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  secretName: kurrentdb-cluster-tls
  isCA: false

    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}.{domain}'
    internodeTrafficStrategy: ServiceName

    certificateSecret:
      name: kurrentdb-cluster-tls
      keyName: tls.crt
      privateKeyName: tls.key
```

Before deploying this cluster, be sure to follow the steps in [Using Self-Signed Certificates](
managing-certificates.md#using-self-signed-certificates).

## Three Node Secure Cluster (using LetsEncrypt)

The following `KurrentDB` resource type defines a three node cluster with the following properties:
- Security is enabled using certificates from LetsEncrypt
- The KurrentDB instance that is provisioned will be exposed as `kurrentdb-{idx}.kurrent.test`
- The LetsEncrypt certificate is only valid for the FQDN (`*.kurrent.test`)
- Clients will dial servers by FQDN
- Server will dial each other by FQDN but because of the `SplitDNS` feature, they will still connect
  via direct pod-to-pod networking, as if they had dialed each other by Kubernetes service name.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  secretName: kurrentdb-cluster-tls
  isCA: false
  usages:
    - client auth
    - server auth
    - digital signature
    - key encipherment
  commonName: '*.kurrent.test'
  subject:
    organizations:
      - Kurrent
    organizationalUnits:
      - Cloud
  dnsNames:
    - '*.kurrent.test'
  privateKey:
    algorithm: RSA
    encoding: PKCS1
    size: 2048
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt
    kind: Issuer
---
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}.{domain}'
    internodeTrafficStrategy: SplitDNS
    clientTrafficStrategy: FQDN
  security:
    certificateReservedNodeCommonName: '*.kurrent.test'
    certificateSecret:
      name: kurrentdb-cluster-tls
      keyName: tls.crt
      privateKeyName: tls.key
```

Before deploying this cluster, be sure to follow the steps in [Using LetsEncrypt Certificates](
managing-certificates.md#using-trusted-certificates-via-letsencrypt).

## Deploying Standalone Read-only Replicas

This example illustrates an advanced topology where a pair of read-only replicas is deployed in a
different Kubernetes cluster than where the quorum nodes are deployed.

We make the following assumptions:
- LetsEncrypt certificates are used everywhere, to ease certificate management
- LoadBalancers are enabled to ensure each node is accessible through its FQDN
- `internodeTrafficStrategy` is `"SplitDNS"` to avoid hairpin traffic patterns between servers
- the quorum nodes will have `-qn` suffixes in their FQDN while the read-only replicas will have
  `-rr` suffixes

This `Certificate` should be deployed in **both** clusters:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: mydb
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  secretName: mydb-tls
  isCA: false
  usages:
    - client auth
    - server auth
    - digital signature
    - key encipherment
  commonName: '*.kurrent.test'
  subject:
    organizations:
      - Kurrent
    organizationalUnits:
      - Cloud
  dnsNames:
    - '*.kurrent.test'
  privateKey:
    algorithm: RSA
    encoding: PKCS1
    size: 2048
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt
    kind: Issuer
```

This `KurrentDB` resource defines the quorum nodes in one cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: mydb
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}-qn.{domain}'
    internodeTrafficStrategy: SplitDNS
    clientTrafficStrategy: FQDN
  security:
    certificateReservedNodeCommonName: '*.kurrent.test'
    certificateSecret:
      name: mydb-tls
      keyName: tls.crt
      privateKeyName: tls.key
```

And this `KurrentDB` resource defines the standalone read-only replica in another cluster.  Notice
that:

- `.replicas` is 0, but `.quorumNodes` is set instead
- `.readOnlyReplicas.replicas` is set
- `fqdnTemplate` differs slightly from above

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: mydb
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 0
  quorumNodes:
    - mydb-0-qn.kurrent.test:2113
    - mydb-1-qn.kurrent.test:2113
    - mydb-2-qn.kurrent.test:2113
  readOnlyReplicas:
    replicas: 2
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}-sa.{domain}'
    internodeTrafficStrategy: SplitDNS
    clientTrafficStrategy: FQDN
  security:
    certificateReservedNodeCommonName: '*.kurrent.test'
    certificateSecret:
      name: mydb-tls
      keyName: tls.crt
      privateKeyName: tls.key
```

## Deploying With Scheduling Constraints

The pods created for a KurrentDB resource can be configured with any of the constraints commonly applied to pods:

- [Node Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
- [Affinity and Anti-Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
- [Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/)
- [Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)
- [Node Name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodename)

For example, in cloud deployments, you may want to maximize uptime by asking each replica of a
KurrentDB cluster to be deployed in a different availability zone.  The following KurrentDB resource
does that, and also requires KurrentDB to schedule pods onto nodes labeled with
`machine-size:large`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: my-kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}.{domain}'
  constraints:
    nodeSelector:
      machine-size: large
    topologySpreadConstraints:
    - maxSkew: 1
      topologyKey: zone
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/part-of: kurrentdb-operator
          app.kubernetes.io/name: my-kurrentdb-cluster
      whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```

If no scheduling constraints are configured, the operator sets a default soft constraint configuring
pod anti-affinity such that multiple replicas will prefer to run on different nodes, for better
fault tolerance.

## Custom Database Configuration

If custom parameters are required in the underlying database configuration then these can be
specified using the `configuration` YAML block within a `KurrentDB`. The parameters which are
defaulted or overridden by the operator are listed [in the CRD reference](
../getting-started/resource-types.md#configuring-kurrent-db).

For example, to enable projections, the deployment configuration looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.kurrent.io/v1
kind: KurrentDB
metadata:
  name: kurrentdb-cluster
  namespace: kurrent
spec:
  replicas: 1
  image: docker.kurrent.io/kurrent-latest/kurrentdb:25.0.0
  configuration:
    RunProjections: all
    StartStandardProjections: true
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 1Gi
  storage:
    volumeMode: "Filesystem"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 512Mi
  network:
    domain: kurrent.test
    loadBalancer:
      enabled: true
    fqdnTemplate: '{podName}.{domain}'
```

## Accessing Deployments

### External

The Operator will create one service of type `LoadBalancer` per KurrentDB node when the
`spec.network.loadBalancer.enabled` flag is set to `true`.

Each service is annotated with `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: {external cluster endpoint}` to allow the third-party tool [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) to configure external access.

### Internal

The Operator will create headless services to access a KurrentDB cluster internally. This includes:
- One for the underlying statefulset (selects all pods)
- One per pod in the statefulset to support `Ingress` rules that require one target endpoint
